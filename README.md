# Bike Count Prediction

A regression-based project to predict bike usage based on weather and seasonal data. The model explores the impact of various conditions on bike counts using multiple machine learning techniques.

# Overview
This project predicts the number of bikes in use under different weather conditions and seasons by analyzing a dataset of hourly bike counts. Multiple regression models are applied to identify patterns.

# Dataset
Key features include:

hour: Time of day
season: Season of the year
weather: Weather condition
count: Target variable for bike counts

# Preprocessing
Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers.
Encoding: Convert categorical variables to numeric.
Scaling: Apply feature scaling to improve model accuracy.
